# Cybersecurity Threat Detection and Awareness Platform

## üõ°Ô∏è Overview

As cyber threats continue to grow in complexity and volume, many individuals‚Äîespecially those without formal training‚Äîstruggle to understand or defend against them. This project presents an integrated, AI-powered cybersecurity platform that simplifies threat detection, education, and response for everyday users.

The platform combines multiple cyber intelligence tools and state-of-the-art machine learning models to provide services such as data breach detection, sentiment and misinformation analysis, phishing and malware scanning, and deepfake identification. A built-in AI advisor delivers expert guidance and clear mitigation steps in real time.
